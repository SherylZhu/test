## Discussion

We found some useful dataset and some tutorials for Pytorch and Tensorflow. I think image classifier is a good idea. And I will learn to run some simple examples on Pytorch and Tensorflow. Also, I am going to run a parallel task on Cirrus. Finally, we plan to choose a past dissertation related to my project for me to read next week.
